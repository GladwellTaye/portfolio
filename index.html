  <h2>About:</h2>
  <h3>My name is Gladwell Angela Taye. I am 19 years old. I graduated last November from Faith Ventures Christian Academy. I am an entrepreneur and the co-founder of an online business, namely Stylezz Accessories.
  I decided to join Moringa because of all the amazing opportunities I have witnessed its graduates receiving. Some of the programmers get six-figure jobs mere weeks after completing the course. That appealed to me immensely. Also, having an Information Technology background in today's global market is an almost unmatched advantage when it comes to being indispensable in any company or industry. Finally, the course duration is only five months, which I find reasonable. It is my belief that my being here is going to be a valuable asset in my professional life moving forward.</h3>
